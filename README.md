# Competitive Programming Solutions

Hi there! Here are my coding solutions from different online platforms. Feel free to explore and learn from them! ðŸ’»

## Programming Languages

Currently, my solutions are written in the following programming languages:

- Bash
- C/C++
- Javascript
- Python

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the platform or contest they belong to. Inside each platform folder, you'll find solutions in different programming languages.

## How to Contribute?

Currently, I'm not accepting contributions, but you can still use the repository as a reference for your own competitive programming journey.

If you have any suggestions or find any problems with the existing solutions, feel free to open an issue, and I'll be happy to discuss it.

<!-- Note: It may not explain how the code works because I'm too lazy to write it ðŸ‘€ -->
